# BallastController
This repository has a few different projects, all related to features used on a wakesurf boat.
1. HMI: a Raspberry Pi-based system with an embedded touchscreen display to work as a human-machine interface running a Flask web app. 
2. BallastPipeLevelSensor: an independent control box with a Teensy 4 to broadcast CAN messages about the status of water in the ballast fill tubes.
3. PipeLevelIndicatorWithWifiUDP: An arduino sketch based on the CAN Logger 3 (Teensy 3.6) to indicate presence of water in the ballast fill tubes.

A project to automatically control filling the ballast tanks on a wakesurf boat with extra bags installed.
